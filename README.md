Created financial Dashboard focused on Profit Analysis using the financial sample dataset provided by Microsoft Power Bi
dataset inside your already installed Power Bi Desktop Version.

This dashboard offers a comprehensive view of Profit Analysis of the sales for consumable products, allowing you to easily analyse performance.

I have incorporated Profit, COGS, Net Sales, Gross Sales in the report.

Learned to create profit negative in the given format for the area chart by using DAX Formulas. 
It is not possible in Power Bi for you to have a default Formatting.
